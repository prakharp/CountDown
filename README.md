In this application, we create an application listview countdown timer in android using Handler class.There lot of problem using a countDown timer in the list as we have created multiples count down the thread as getting view method would create this would slow down listview and it even scrolls doesn't show correct count in some cases.
Alternately We have handled it the following way: in the Custom List Adapter, inside Adapter I create a new Hander which subtracting 1 sec from the count and saves count down value in a model and then displays remaining time listview TextView.
